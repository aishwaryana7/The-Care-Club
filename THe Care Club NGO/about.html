                This  organisation helps people access mental, physical, interpersonal, 
                social recovery and assists with the necessary resources in various rural and urban settings. 
                It provides emergency and community-based mental health interventions to aid people on their
                 paths towards overall well-being. The care club promotes best practices through collaborations
                  with governmental and non-profit initiatives. Here people can access emergency and critical care services, 
                  obtain food, shelter and clothing alongside health, reintegration and aftercare services.
                   75% of women enrolled here have recovered with their assistance.
